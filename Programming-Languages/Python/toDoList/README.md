# toDoList
To do list based on SQL.
# What I learnt from this project:
 * I learnt how to use sql in python thanks to SQLAlchemy library. (How to set-up a database, add and delete datas from it and manage it.)
 * I learnt how to manage my database by using RDMS. (Rational Database Management System)
 * I learnt how to use 'datetime' library and how to benefit from this library to use in SQLAlchemy library.
