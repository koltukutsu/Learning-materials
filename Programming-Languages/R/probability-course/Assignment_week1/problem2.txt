#A service agency wishes to assess its clients’ views on quality of
#service over the past year. Computer records identify 1000
#clients over the past 12 months, and a decision is made to select
#100 clients to survey.
#(a) Describe a procedure for selecting a simple random sample
#of 100 clients from last year’s population of 1000 clients.
#(b) The population of 1000 clients consists of 800 CaucasianAmericans, 150 African-Americans and 50 Hispanic-Americans.
#Describe an alternative procedure for selecting a representative
#random sample of size 100 from the population of 1000 clients.
#(c) Give the R commands for implementing the sampling
#procedures described in parts (a) and (b).
