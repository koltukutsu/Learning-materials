git checkout -b feature => this creates a new branch called 'feature'
git commit -m "~~~~"

git stash -u -> this is for half finished and experimental things
git stash pop -> if I do it, it turns to the current branch 

git merge feature -> merges feature with the branch
git merge feature --squash

git push -u origin master
